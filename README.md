## üìù What is the Google Play Store Apps Analysis?
> The following tableau file analyzes data found on Kaggle.com on Google Play Store Apps from 2018. The following project will analyze:
-  Apps by Ranking
-  Apps by Genres
-  Paid vs. Unpaid Apps

## üë©‚Äçüè´ Project Walk Through

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Source ###
> For this project I chose a data set off of Kaggle.com. And the data set that I found was on Google Play Store Apps from 2018. Essentially the purpose of this data set was to collect a bunch of information about several hundred applications and see how they measure out using different analyses. Collected for this data set were application names (which are the names of the many apps you can download off of Play Store), application category (which are the categories the Play Store groups these apps by), rating (which is an average of different ratings given by app users), reviews (which are the amount of reviews the app has), size (referring to the size of the app), installs (which is the amount of times the app was installed by different users), type (whether the game is free or paid), price (which refers to the price given if a paid game), content rating (or the audience the app is targeted at), genres (which refers to the theme or purpose of the app), last updated (which informs us of when the app was last updated), and lastly the version of the app.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Visualization #1: Top Rated Apps ###

>For our first visualization, I wanted to see some of the top-rated apps for the year 2018. To do this, I simply created a table that contained the rating and app dimensions. After doing so, I added a rating slider that would allow me and other users to interact with the table and change the rating to whatever rating they wanted to look at. As mentioned before, I was curious about some of the top rated apps for the year of 2018, thus to figure this out I went over to the rating slider and changed the slider rating to the highest rating of 5.0. By doing this, the table automatically updates with new apps that all contain a 5.0 rating. This feature can be particularly useful for users that are quickly trying to find a useful and a fully verified application by other users, on the run. Aside from this, this rating slider can also come in quite handy to other app developers looking to see where there apps sit on the scale of ratings and what applications they can look up to, to improve their own.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Visualization #2: Apps by Genres ###
>Our next visualization takes the top-rated apps from the first visualization and categorizes them by genres. When making this visualization, I was interested in what kind of applications were the highest rated by users and whether there was any sort of pattern. Going into this visualization open-minded, I was expecting some of the top rated applications to be perhaps photo editing apps, game for entertainment, and/or social media platforms as it seems like people spend most of their time on phones using those type of apps. However, that was not the case with this data set and analysis. According to the pie chart, the top rated apps from 2018 were categorized into Education, Medical, and Lifestyle. Now even though I‚Äôm still a bit perplexed about the top rated Medical apps, I am not surprised that some of the top rated applications landed in the Education and Lifestyle category. Today, more than any time ever, children are using electronic devices to play games and perhaps, with a little encouragement from their parents, trying out new educational applications. Similarly, adults also rely a lot on these educational applications as many adults are constantly busy with work, family or other responsibilities, needing a fast and accessible resource to learn on the fly, like an app. This representation, however, comes to show that even though a lot of phone users do sit on their phones to play games, check out social media, or edit photos, doesn‚Äôt mean that those apps, no matter how popular they may be, are perfect. Just comes to show that even the most popular applications have room to improve to perhaps one day become a top-rated app.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Visualization #3: Paid vs. Unpaid Apps ###
> For my third and final visualization, I decided to analyze whether paid applications live up to the unpaid applications standards in terms of installations. So, in other words, do paid applications, no matter how incredible they may be, get equally as many people installing them as unpaid applications? According to this visualization, that claim is false. If we hover over the installs dropdown and select the most installed applications, we can see that all of them are unpaid or free. This makes sense as most people today are not willing to even pay a dime for an app that they may not even end up using. However, despite this being the case in 2018, this was not the case 5 to 10 years ago when many apps on the App Store or Play Store used to be paid. This just shows that with time either people became less willing to pay for applications that give minimal results or application developers have found a new way of making money such as through in app purchases that users make. Just like any other technology, applications are constantly changing, thus if you plan to be an application developer it would be in your best interest to do some market research and see in what ways, if any, you can make a profit off of your app.
